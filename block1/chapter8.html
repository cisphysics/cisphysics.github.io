                <p>What is the magnitude of the momentum of a 10,000-kg truck whose speed is 12.0 m/s? (b) What speed would a 2000-kg
                    SUV have to attain in order to have (i) the same momentum? (ii) the same kinetic energy?</p>

                <p>In a certain men's track and field event, the shotput has a mass of 7.30 kg and is released with a speed of 15.0 m/s
                    at 40.0$^{\circ}$ above the horizontal over a man's straight left leg. What are the initial horizontal and vertical

                <p>The expanding gases that leave the muzzle of a rifle also contribute to the recoil. A .30-caliber bullet has a mass
                    0.00720 kg and a speed of 601 m/s relative to the muzzle when pired from a rifle that has mass 2.80 kg. The loosely
                    held rifle recoils at a speed of 1.85 m/s relative to the earth. Find the momentum of the propellant gases in a
                    coordinate system attached to the earth as they leave the muzzle of the rifle.</p>

                <p>A 68.5-kg astronaut is doing a repair in space on the orbiting space station. She throws a 2.25-kg tool away from her

                <p>Two skaters collide and grab on to each other on friction-less ice. One of them, of mass 70.0 kg, is moving to the
                    right at 2.00 m/s, while the other, of mass 65.0 kg, is moving to the left at 2.50 m/s. What are the magnitude and

                <p>A 15.0-kg fish swimming at 1.10 m/s suddenly gobbles up a 4.50-kg fish that is initially stationary. Neglect any drag
                    effects of the water. (a) Find the speed of the large fish just after it eats the small one. (b) How much mechanical

                <p>A 0.150-kg glider is moving to the right on a frictionless, horizontal air track with a speed of 0.80 m/s. It has
                    a head-on collision with a 0.300-kg glider that is moving to the left with a speed of 2.20 m/s. Find the final
                    velocity (magnitude and direction) of each glider if the collision is elastic.</p>

                <h6 class="docs-header">Problem 8.47</h6>
                <p>Blocks A (mass 2.00 kg) and B (mass 10.00 kg) move on a frictionless, horizontal surface. Initially, block B is at
                    rest and block A is moving toward it at 2.00 m/s. The blocks are equipped with ideal spring bumpers (the relative
                    velocities before and after collision are equal). The collision is head-on, so all motion before and after the
                    collision is along a straight line. (a) Find the maximum energy stored in the spring bumpers and the velocity of each
                    block at that time. (b) Find the velocity of each block after they have moved apart.</p>
