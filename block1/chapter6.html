                <p>In April 13, 2029 (Friday the 13th!), the asteroid 99942 Apophis will pass within 18,600 mi of the earth - about
                    $\frac{1}{13}$ the distance to the moon! It has a density of 2600 kg/m$^3$, can be modeled as a sphere 320 in
                    diameter, and will be travelling at 12.6 km/s. (a) If, due to a small disturbance in its orbit, the asteroid were
                    to hit the earth, how muchkinetic energy would it deliver? (b) The largest nuclear bomb ever tested by the United
                    States was the "Castle/Bravo" bomb, having a yield of 15 megatons of TNT. (A megaton of TNT releases 4.184 $\times$
                    10$^{15}$ J of energy). How many Castle/Bravo bombs would be equivalent to the energy of the Apophis?</p>

                <p>A luggage handler pulls a 20.0-kg suitcase up a ramp inclide at 25.0$^{\circ}$ above the horizontal by a force
                    $\vec{F}$ of magnitude 140 N that acts parallel to the ramp. The coefficent of kinetic friction between the ramp
                    and the incline is $\mu_k$ = 0.300. If the suitcase travels 3.80 m along the ramp, calculate (a) the work done on
                    the suitcase by the force $\vec{F}$; (b) the work done on the suitcase by the gravitational force; (c) the work done
                    on the suitcase by the normal force; (d) the work done on the suitcase by the friction force; (e) the total work done
                    on the suitcase. (f) If the speed of the suitcase is zero at the bottom of the ramp, what is its speed after it has
                    traveled 3.80 m along the ramp?</p>

                <p>While doing a chin-up, a man lifts his body 0.04 m. (a) How much work must the man do per kilogram of body mass? (b)
                    The muscles involved in doing a chin-up can generate about 70 J of work per kilogram of muscle mass. If the man can
                    just barely do a 0.40-m chin-up, what percentage of his body's mass do these muscles constitute? (For comparison,
                    the <i>total</i> percentage of muscle in a typical 70-kg man with 14% body fat is about 43%). (c) Repeat part (b)
                    for the man's young son, who has arms half as long as his father's but whose muscles can also generate 70 J of work
                    per kilogram of muscle mass. (d) Adults and children have about the same percentage of muscle mass in their bodies.
                    Explain why childgren can commonly do chin-ups more easily than their fathers.</p>

                <p>A 20.0-kg crate sits at rest at the bottom of a 15.0-m-long ramp that is inclined at 34.0$^{\circ}$ about the
                    horizontal. A constant horizontal force of 290 N is applied to the crate to push it up the ramp. While the crate
                    is moving, the ramp exerts a constant frictional force on it that has magnitude 65.0 N. (a) What is the total work
                    done on the crate during its motion from the bottom to the top of the ramp? (b) How much time does it take the crate
                    to travel to the top of the ramp?</p>
