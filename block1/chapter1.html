                <p>An acre, a unit of land measurement still in wide use, has a length of one furlong ($\frac{1}{8}$ mi) and a width of
                    one-tenth of its length. (a) How many acres are in a square mile? (b) How many square feet are in an acre? (c)
                    An acre-foot is the volume of water that would cover 1 acre of flat land to a depth of 1 foot. How many gallons
                    are in 1 acre-foot?</p>

                <p>In January 2006 astronomers reported the discovery of a planet comparable in size to the earth orbiting another
                    star and having a mass of about 5.5 times the earth's mass. It is believed to consist of a mixture of rock and
                    ice, similar to Neptune. If this planet has the same density as Neptune (1.76 g/cm$^3$), what is its radius
                    expressed (a) in kilometers and (b) as a multiple of earth's radius?</p>

                <p>You can use the radio waves generated by a hydrogen maser as a standard of frequency. The frequency of these waves
                    is 1,420,405,751,786 hertz. (A hertz is another name for one cycle per second). A clock controlled by a hydrogen
                    maser is off by only 1 s in 100,000 years. For the follwing questions, use only three significant figures. (The
                    large number of significant figures given for the frequency simply illustrates the remarkable accuracy to which it
                    has been measured). (a) What is the time for one cycle of the radio wave? (b) How many cycles occur in 1 h? (c)
                    How many cycles would have occurred during the age of the earth, which is estimated to be 4.6 $\times$ 10$^9$
                    years? (d) By how many seconds would a hydrogen maser clock be off after a time interval equal to the age of
                    the earth?</p>

                <p>The density of air under standard laboratory conditions is 1.29 kg/m$^3$, and about 20% of that air consists of
                    oxygen. Typically, people breathe about $\frac{1}{2}$ L of air per breath. (a) How many grams of oxygen does a
                    person breathe in a day? (b) If this air is stored uncompressed in a cubical tank, how long is each side of
                    the tank?</p>
