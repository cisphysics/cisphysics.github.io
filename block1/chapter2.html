                <p>A typical male sprinter can maintain his maximum acceleration for 2.0 s and his maximum speed is 10 m/s. After
                    reaching this maximum speed, his acceleration becomes zero and then he runs at a constant speed. Assume that
                    his acceleration is constant during the first 2.0 s of the race, that he starts from rest, and that he runs in
                    a straight line. (a) How far has the sprinter run when he reaches his maximum speed? (b) What is the magnitude of
                    his average velocity for a race of the following lengths: (i) 50.0 m, (ii) 100.0 m, (iii) 200.0 m?</p>

                <p>On a 20-mile bike ride, you ride the first 10 miles at an average speed of 8 mi/h. What must your average speed
                    over the next 10 miles be to have your average speed for the total 20 miles be (a) 4 mi/h? (b) 12 mi/h? (c) Given
                    this average speed for the first 10 miles, can you possibly attain an average speed of 16 mi/h for the total
                    20-mile ride? Explain.</p>

                <p>The position of a paritcle between $t$ = 0 and $t$ = 2.00 s is given by $x(t)$ = (3.00 m/s$^3$)$t^3$ -
                    (10.0 m/s$^2$)$t^2$ + (9.00 m/s)$t$. (a) Draw the $x$-$t$, $v_x$-$t$, and $a_x$-$t$ graphs of this particle.
                    (b) At what time(s) between $t$ =  0 and $t$ = 2.00 s is the particle instantaneously at rest? Does your
                    numerical result agree with the $v_x$-$t$ graph in part (a)? (c) At each time calculated in part (b), is
                    the acceleration of the particle positive or negative? Show that in each case the same answer is deduced from
                    $a_x(t)$ and from the $v_x$-$t$ graph. (d) At what time(s) between $t$ = 0 and $t$ = 2.00 s is the velocity of
                    the particle instantaneously not changing? Locate this point on the $v_x$-$t$ and $a_x$-$t$ graphs of part (a).
                    (e) What is the particle's greatest distance from the origin ($x$ = 0) between $t$ = 0 and $t$ = 2.00 s? (f) At
                    what time(s) between $t$ = 0 and $t$ = 2.00 s is the particle <i>speeding up</i> at the greatest rate? At what
                    time(s) between $t$ = 0 and $t$ = 2.00 s is the particle slowing down at the greatest rate? Locate these points
                    on the $v_x$-$t$ and $a_x$-$t$ graphs of part (a).</p>

                <p>A lunar lander is descending toward the moon's surface. Until the lander reaches the surface, its height above
                    the surface of the moon is given by $y(t)=b-ct+dt^2$, where $b$ = 800 m is the initial height of the lander above
                    the surface, $c$ = 60 m/s, and $d$ = 1.05 m/s$^2$. (a) What is the initial velocity of the lander, at $t$ = 0? (b)
                    What is the velocity of the lander just before it reaches the lunar surface?</p>
