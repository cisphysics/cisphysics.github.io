                <p>In one day, a 75-kg mountain climber ascends from the 1500-m level on a vertical cliff to the top at 2400 m. The next
                    day, sche descends from the top to the base of the cliff, which is at an elevation of 1350 m. What is her change in
                    gravitational potential energy (a) on the first day and (b) on the second day?</p>

                <p>The maximum height a typical human can jump from a crouched start is about 60 cm. By how much does the gravitational
                    potential energy increase for a 72-kg person in such a jump? Where does this energy come from?</p>

                <p>An ideal spring of negligible mass is 12.00 cm long when nothing is attached to it. When you hang a 3.15-kg weight
                    from it, you measure its length to be 13.40 cm. If you wanted to store 10.0 J of potential energy in this spring,
                    what would be its <i>total</i> length? Assume that it continues to obey Hooke's law.</p>

                <p>A force of 800 N stretches a certain spring a distance of 0.200 m. (a) What is the potential energy of the spring
                    when it is strectched 0.200 m? (b) What is its potential energy when it is compressed 5.00 cm?</p>

                <h6 class="docs-header">Problem 7.40</h6>
                <p>Two blocks with different masses are attached to either end of a light rope that passes over a light, frictionless
                    pulley suspended from the ceiling. The masses are released from rest, and the more massive one starts to descend.
                    After this block has descended 1.20 m, its speed is 3.00 m/s. If the total mass of the two blocks is 15.0 kg, what
                    is the mass of each block?</p>

                <h6 class="docs-header">Problem 7.41</h6>
                <p>At a construction site, a 65.0-kg bucket of concrete hangs from a light (but string) cable that passes over a light,
                    friction-free pulley and is connected to an 80.0-kg box on a horizontal roof (Fig. P7.41). The cable pulls horizontally
                    on the box, and a 50.0-kg bag of gravel rests on top of the box. The coefficents of friction between the box and roof
                    are shown. (a) Find the friction force on the bag of gravel and the box. (b) suddenly a worker picks up the bag of
                    gravel. Use energy conservation to find the speed of the bucket after it has descended 2.00 m from rest. (You can
                    check your answer by solving this problem using Newton's laws).</p>
